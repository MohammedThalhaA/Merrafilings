const FAQ_COL_1 = [
  {
    q: "What is a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)?",
    a: "An LLP is an incorporated corporate body combining the flexibility of an ordinary partnership firm with the limited liability protections of a private limited company. Formed under the LLP Act 2008, it is a separate legal entity distinct from its partners, meaning partners are not personally liable for the debts or wrongful acts of other partners.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many partners are required to register an LLP?",
    a: "A minimum of two partners are required to form an LLP. There is no statutory upper limit on the maximum number of partners. At least two partners must be designated partners, and at least one designated partner must be an Indian resident (residing in India for not less than 120 days during the financial year).",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there any minimum capital requirement for starting an LLP?",
    a: "No! There is no mandatory minimum capital requirement to incorporate an LLP. Partners can commence operations with any nominal contribution, such as ₹1,000 or ₹10,000. Capital can be contributed in monetary form or through tangible/intangible assets.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a statutory audit mandatory for an LLP in India?",
    a: "No! Unlike Private Limited Companies which require statutory audits from day one, an LLP is legally exempt from audit if its annual turnover does not exceed ₹40 Lakhs or its partner capital contribution does not exceed ₹25 Lakhs. This significantly reduces ongoing accounting and compliance overhead.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is an LLP Agreement and why must it be filed within 30 days?",
    a: "The LLP Agreement is the foundational constitutional charter defining the rights, duties, capital contributions, profit-sharing ratios, and managerial responsibilities of partners. Under Section 23 of the LLP Act, this agreement must be executed on judicial stamp paper and filed with the MCA in Form 3 within 30 days of incorporation.",
  },
];

const FAQ_COL_2 = [
  {
    q: "What is DPIN and is it mandatory for all partners?",
    a: "DPIN stands for Designated Partner Identification Number. It is a unique 8-digit identification number allotted by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). It is mandatory for all designated partners in an LLP. If a partner already possesses a DIN (Director Identification Number), the same number functions as DPIN.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can NRIs and foreign nationals become partners in an Indian LLP?",
    a: "Yes. Foreign nationals and NRIs can become partners and designated partners in an LLP. Under the automatic FDI route, 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted in LLPs operating in sectors where 100% FDI is allowed without performance-linked conditions. At least one designated partner must be a resident of India.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the mandatory annual filings for an LLP?",
    a: "An LLP must complete two primary statutory MCA filings every year: (1) Form 11 (Annual Return) within 60 days of fiscal year end (due on or before May 30th), and (2) Form 8 (Statement of Account & Solvency) within 30 days of the end of 6 months of fiscal year end (due on or before October 30th). Additionally, Income Tax Return Form ITR-5 must be filed annually.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which is better for startups: LLP or Private Limited Company?",
    a: "An LLP is ideal for bootstrapping founders, professional service practices, consultancies, and family businesses that seek limited liability, lower compliance burdens, audit exemption (up to ₹40L turnover), and no dividend distribution tax. A Private Limited Company is preferable if you plan to raise institutional VC/seed equity funding or issue ESOPs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can an existing partnership firm be converted into an LLP?",
    a: "Yes. Under Section 55 and the Second Schedule of the LLP Act 2008, an existing general partnership firm registered under the Indian Partnership Act 1932 can be converted into an LLP seamlessly without attracting capital gains tax, provided all partners transition in identical shareholding proportions.",
  },
];

const FAQ_EXTRA_COL_1 = [
  {
    q: "Can a salaried individual become a partner in an LLP?",
    a: "Yes, an employed individual can become a partner in an LLP, provided their existing employment contract or employer's HR policies do not prohibit holding directorships or commercial partnerships in external businesses.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the tax rate applicable to an LLP in India?",
    a: "An LLP is taxed as a separate legal firm at a flat corporate tax rate of 30% plus surcharge and health & education cess. Notably, profits distributed to partners after paying corporate tax are completely tax-free in the hands of the individual partners.",
  },
];

const FAQ_EXTRA_COL_2 = [
  {
    q: "Can a residential property be used as the registered office for an LLP?",
    a: "Yes, a residential property owned or rented by any partner can be used as the registered office address. You only need to provide a recent electricity or gas bill, along with a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the property owner.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if the LLP Agreement is not filed within 30 days?",
    a: "Delay in filing Form 3 attracts a statutory MCA late fee of ₹100 per day until rectified. Merrafilings ensures your LLP Agreement is drafted, executed on judicial stamp paper, and filed with the MCA well within the prescribed 30-day window.",

                  A <strong className="font-medium text-slate-800">Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)</strong> is one of the most preferred corporate business vehicles in India for service providers, consultants, software agencies, and co-founded ventures. Introduced under the <strong className="font-medium text-slate-800">Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008</strong>, an LLP combines the operational flexibility of a partnership with the limited liability protections of a private limited company.

                  Unlike traditional partnership firms, an LLP operates as a <strong className="font-medium text-slate-800">separate legal entity</strong>. The personal wealth and private assets of individual partners remain shielded from business liabilities, debts, or misdeeds of other partners. With <a href="/" className="text-[#00B074] hover:underline font-normal">Merrafilings</a>, you get transparent, end-to-end guidance from MCA name approval to stamp paper agreement execution.
